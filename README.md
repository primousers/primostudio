# PrimoFeaturesJSON

`features.json` is a file which lists the various add-ons available for installation through Primo-Studio.

The file consists a JSON-Array which holds JSON-Objects. Each object in the array is called a descriptor and defines a single add-on.

Example descriptor:
```
	{
		"face": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/905906120794963968/lHQ0ivpW_400x400.jpg",
		"notes": "Add a nav bar underneath the search bar to provide additional links in the primo-explore UI",
		"who": "NYU Libraries",
		"what": "primo-explore-search-bar-sub-menu",
		"linkGit": "https://github.com/NYULibraries/primo-explore-search-bar-sub-menu",
		"npmid": "search-bar-sub-menu-studio",
		"version": "0.0.4",
		"hook": "prm-search-bar-after",
		"config": {
			"multiple":5,
			"form":
			[
				{"key":"name"},
				{"key":"description"},
				{"key":"action"},
				{"key":"iconSet", "templateOptions":{"label": "icon set"}},
				{"key":"iconName", "templateOptions":{"label": "icon name"}},
				{"key":"cssClasses"},
				{"key":"show_xs"}
			]
		}
	}
```

## Descriptor

A descriptor is a JSON-Object consisting the following fields :

| name | type | usage |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `face` | string: required | URL of image icon to be placed next to add button |
| `what` | string: required | Tilte of add-on |
| `notes` | string: required | Brief description of add-on |
| `linkGit` | string: required | URL link for github of add-on |
| `npmid` | string: required | ID of add-on as published on NPM |
| `version` | string: required | Version of add-on to be installed from NPM. Necessary in order to update add-on in Primo Studio|
| `hook` | string: required | Name of hook where want to place add-on. E.g: prm-search-bar-after
| `systemExclusive` | string: optional | System where the feature only works there, `primo` or `ve`. The field is optional because by default any feature should work for both systems, but on special cases (requests, locations, etc...) there is option to limit the system to just one system (`primo` \ `ve`)
| `config` | JSON-Object: optional | Object defining a form that will be opened in Primo Studio where users can enter configuration parameters for add-on. See Below.  |


### 'config' field

The config field of a descriptor is optional and if added will cause Primo-Studio to open a form prompting user to enter the requested parameters when installing the add-on. 
'config' is a JSON-Object consisting the following fields: 

| name | type | usage |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `multiple` | Number: optional default:1 | Max number of forms that are able to be set by the user for the add-on.  e.g: Each form defines a link that will be placed under the search bar and we want to allow up to 5 links.|
| `form` | JSON-Array: required | Json-Array where each element is a JSON-Object defining an input field in the form. See below.  |

The form field is JSON-Array where each element is a JSON-Object defining a single input field in the form. e.g:  
```
    [
		{"key":"name"},
		{"key":"description"},
		{"key":"action"},
		{"key":"iconSet", "templateOptions":{"label": "icon set"}},
		{"key":"iconName", "templateOptions":{"label": "icon name"}},
		{"key":"cssClasses"},
		{"key":"show_xs"}
    ]
```

The simplest example for defining a form field is adding only a key parameter. e.g:  `````{"key":"name"}`````. In this case the form will consist of a field whose title is "name". The parameter will be accessed in the add-on code through the key "name".

If you would like to define a field whose title and key are different you could define the following object for example:  
```{"key":"iconSet", "templateOptions":{"label": "icon set"}}```
